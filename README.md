### Anton Alekseev

Hey there! I work @ [Thorgate](https://thorgate.eu) as a Tech Lead & Fullstack Developer. Most of my time I plan upcoming work for my team, clean-up legacy code, write documentation & tests. My main working language is Python, but I do love working with React and creating slick UIs.

Originally born in the city of Vladivostok, near the Sea of Japan, I now live with my wife Ann & two cats - Pirate and Martini in Tallinn, Estonia (9.000 km from original location).
